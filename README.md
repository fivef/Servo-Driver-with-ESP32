# Servo-Driver-with-ESP32

### Description:

Application for the Waveshare Servo Driver with ESP32.

Main Differneces compared to the original version:

- MODE: SF  (Default) Serial forwarding, allows to control the servos via serial commands over the USB-C cable. 
Pressing the "Boot" button changes to the WIFI control mode where it displays the SSID you can connect to and the IP address to control the servos via an web application.

- The firmware is automatically built using github actions and can be flashed directly via the browser without the need to download any tool or the firmware.
- Platform IO support for better and easier building than with Arduino IDE
